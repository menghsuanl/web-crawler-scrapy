# web-crawler-scrapy
## getbooks.py
This is a Python script that uses the Scrapy library to scrape book information from the website books.toscrape.com. The script defines a spider called getbooks that navigates to each book page on the website and extracts the title, price, rating, and availability of the book. 
The spider can save this information to a CSV file named on your own. The script uses CSS selectors to extract data from the website's HTML pages and demonstrates how to use Scrapy's functionality to navigate a website and extract data from it.
